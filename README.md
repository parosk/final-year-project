# final-year-project
The repository is the matlab code I wrote during my final year (2014-2015), the topic is " Magnetic Field strength of  molecular cloud by using polarisation data "

Abstract
This project  tries to determine the plane of sky component of magnetic field in molecular 
cloud by magnetic field morphology, obtained from linearly polarized sub-millimeter thermal 
emission of molecular cloud. This report will present the relevant Physics background of 
molecular cloud formation, the improvement that have been made in this semester, and 
compare with the standard result.
